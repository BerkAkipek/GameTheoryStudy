# Game Theory 

If a player's movfe dfoes effect your strategy this is a game. 
Game Theory is the study of strategic interactions. 

## Keynes Beauty Contest 

This model of stock market is founded by John Maynard Keynes. 
Suppouse there is a Bauty Contest. 
The Most Beautifull Woman is chosen by unanimity of people. 

Imprtant thing is not who is going to win the contest. 
The important thing is the predict the average choice of the crowd. 

This model shows stock market. 
If you buy stock that others are going to buy, stock price will increase and you will win.

## Thaler's Number Guessing Game

This model is developed by Richard Taylor in 1997.
He ran an experiment on Financial Times magazine.
Suppouse you picked a number in between 0 to 100. 
Winner has to predict the numnber 2/3 of the average guess. 

if everybody played with no reasoning and choose the biggest number 100, then winner number has to be 2/3 of 100 which is 67. 

Any guess above 67 is dominated by 67.
This means every other strategy is better then choosing a number above 67. 

Let's say everybody choosed randomly. 
Makles avrage 50 which means winner number is 33.
If others have reasoning they must think this so, winner number must be 2/3 of 33 which is 22.
This process can go until guess reaches 0.
If all players have common knowledge of reasoning you must choose 0.
In the experiment 33 winned the contest.
Valid strategy is stopping reasoning at 1st level.

In real experiment average number wasa 19 and who choose 13 won the contest. 
There was a lot of people who choose 100 which is bounded by 67. 
Either these people do not understand ther game or can't take 2/3 of a number. 

Valid strategy must be chosen by other participants actions. 

Reasoning can solve wide range of problems but humans do not have infinite reasoning.
Humans' reasoning called as 'Bounded Reasoning'.
It depends on the comnplexity of situation, time, importance of the problem etc.

## Bubbles 

In stock market we see Bubbles.
Bubble means excessively increasing price. 
This is because of all participants rational but there is a lack of common knowledge of rationality. 

## Simultaneous Move Games 

When a player does not know opponent's choice when making his choice, this type of games called Simultaneous Move Games. 
Either player can move simultaneously or turn by turn in different times if they don't know what what opponent's choice this makes a simultanous move game.

## Normal Form Of A Game 

This is a Normal(Strategic) Form of a game. 
It's a matrix. 
Each row corresponds a move for player1 and each column corresponds a move for player2.
Intersection in between one column  and row there is payoff shown for each player. 
Both player can see this matrix and can take action in order to play it. 

## Nash Equilibrium

Nash eqilibrium is an idea that older then John Nash.
In equilibrium every player must play moves most beneficial to them.

John Nash is the first person who implemented the idea mathematically.

It is a regret free method.
Deviating from Nash Equilibrium is not beneficial for both players.
If you can create an accurate strategy matrix for each player both maximum values combination in a square is Nash Equilibrium.

## Prisoner's Dilemma 

Suppouse two person, Alan and Ben, found guilty from grand theft auto.
Police also suspects that they killed someone but has no evidence. 

Each man is interrogated in a different room so this is a simultaneous move game.
There are two choices for each individual, confess or remain silent. 
This will create four possible outcomes;

1. They both remain silent.
2. Alan confesses, Ben remains silent. 
3. Alan remains silent, Ben confesses.
4. They both confess.

If one confesses and other remains silent who remains silent will go to jail for 15 years.
If both confess they both will go to jail for 10 years. 
If they both remain silent they will go to jail for 1 year.

Best possible outcome happens if they cooperate and remain silent.
But this is not equilibrium you can see from normal matrix confessing is much more plausible if other remains silent.
Also if you remain silent and your partner confesses you are going to jail for 15 years.
So equilibrium is that they both confess and go jail for 10 years. 

But you can clearly see that cooperating and remaining silent is better for both criminals.

This dilemma shows that choosing to cooperate is so hard in a simultaneous move game when there is a factor of self interest or risk of loosing.

In common knowledge of reasoning both players cooperate and remain silent.

## Pareto Efficiency 

So let's say there is a choice for each player. 
With these choices choices each player increases their payoff without hurting each other.
This set of choices are Pareto efficient.

Prisoners' Dilemma in equilibrium is not Pareto Efficient because if both players remain silent they can increase the payoffs without hurting each other.

This notion of distributional efficiency is founded by Vilfredo Pareto.

## The Tragedy of Commons

People can act with self-interest rather then the best interest of whole group and decrease the feeding potential of Commonland.

We can see Prisoners' Dilemma in so many situation.
Cooperating is the result of common knowledge of rationality in most situations.

We must share the resources rather than acting with self-interest.
This will make best common outcome.

If one's best payoff hurts the other and vice versa we can call this conflict-of-interest.
In such a situation playing with best payoff creates equilibrium but this is not the best possible outcome for most situations.

## Nuclear Build-Up

Prisoners' Dilemma is first created in Cold War.
The participants are USA and USSR.
Each player can increase their nuclear arsenal or not which is cost efficient.

But if a country chooses pasifism the other will become super-power or vice versa.
So making bombs is rational for each player. 
The Nash Equiibrium of the game is making weapons. 

This is not Pareto Efficient each country is better of if they do not produce Nuclear Weapons.

## Cooperation 

In Prisoners' Dilemma there is a good payoff if both players are cooperate.
Also if both players cooperate this will yield a pareto efficient result.

There is a good example which shows this situation the Roammate Game. 
Suppouse that Alice and Beth are room mates. 
Both of them don't like to cleaning the dishes but they want a clean kitchen. 

If they both do not clean dishes, They will get happiness 10.
If alice does the dishes andf Beth free-rides Alice gets 8 happiness Beth gets 20 happiness, vice versa.
If they cooperate they will get 14 happiness both.

Best move for each player is 'Don't clean up the dishes'.
In Nash Equilibrium both player do not clean up the dishes. 
Incentive of a free-ride rises and both players expect the other to clean up. 

## Education 

In Roommate Game equilibrium is the situation where the both players don't clean up.
One solution to this problem is changing payoffs in payoff matrix.
Let's say both players get a good education early on their life. 
Happiness of them is reducing 7 from non-cooperative behaviour.

This situation gives a new matrix. 

You can see from matrix, moral cost of non-cooperative behaviour changed the equilibrium.
Now strategic choice for both player is the cooperate. 

## Environmental Policies And Cooperation 

Youcan see the Roommate Game's results on global environmental policies problem. 
There is no fully chosen environmental policy treaty.

Some countries cooperate and choose to costly ways to reduce CO2 emission.

But it is hard to get major polluters (USA, China, India).
It is like having messy rommates who want a free-ride. 

Good education on people can create a moral cost on the politicians who do not protect the environment. 
This can help us about our frtee rider problem. 

## Multiplicity Of Equilibrium

From start we always looked at the games with one equilibrium. 
What about a game with multiple equilibrium?
Can we predict the outcome of such a game?

## Battle Of Sexes

There can be multiple Nash Equilibrium for a game.
The Battle of Sexes game shows this situation well.

Suppouse that a couple Amy and Bob decided to spend the evening together. 
Bob wants to go to football match with Amy.
Amy wants to go to dance class with Bob.

If they go to football match Bob will recieve 10 happiness Amy 5.
If they go to dance class Amy will receive 10 happiness Bob 5.
They both wants to spend time together if they get seperated they will get 0 happiness. 

They decided to make a decision before evening on the phone. 
But phone system failed so this is a simultaneous move game. 

If they think differently and ended up being seperated, this is called coordination failure. 
Coordination Failure can be result of a game with multiple equilibrium. 
There is certain ways to avoid a coordination failure. 

## Social Norms 

If the game has more then one equilibrium psychology and culture comes to play.
We can expect male dominance in a patriarch society. 
This is the reason why it is so hard to move a fairer system. 

## Bank Runs

Banks work with expectation. 
They get deposition and loans from depositors and return it with interest. 
This creates many investments and credits. 

However there is as risk. 
If all depositors wants their money back this will cause a 'Bank Run'.
Bank can't give all the money back. 
Bank runs their bussinesses around trust and this creates a game with multiple equilibrium.

The belief that there will be a bank run is a 'self-fullfilling expectation'.
This means expectation itself can cause a Bank Run.

The Central Bank is like a last resort for banks to protect them from a bak run.

## Mixed Strategie Nash Equilibrium

Until this time we looked at games with pure-strategy equilibrium. 
There are certain types of game with no equilibrium. 

Let's look at game Rock Paper Scissorss.
There is 1/3 chance of winning, 1/3 chance of loosing, 1/3 chance of tying for each choice. 
There is no Nash Equilibrium. 

This type of games called zero sum games. 

There is a strategy for the Rock Paper Scissorss. 
If you play a move more often, your opponent can play for win with certanity. 
So playing it with completaly randomized fashion force's your opponent to play with a random möove. 
This is a Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium. 

## The Currency Speculastion Game

In "Black Wednesday" 16 September 1992 investors think that pound devalued.
They get their pounds and buy German Marks. 
Thyis was a speculative attack; there was no way to predict this and devalue pound by central bank.

On the day Bank bought 4 billion pounds to counter market loss. 
However pound lost it's value more thenm 10 percent.
So Investors got a lot of benefit from it. 

This is an example of speclative attack.
It is unpredictable from it's nature. 
There is no pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. 

## Chicken Game

Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium is appealing when a player wnats to be unpredictable in a Multiple Nash Equilibrium Game. 
Suppouse two teenager are driving towwards each other.
There is a Nash Equilibrium. 
One player continous straight other turns off, because avoiding crash is a goodf strategy. 
But first player who turns of became chicken.

The teenager who wants to be rebel can move with Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium and turns off in a random time. 

One of the results of Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium in Chicken Game is crash. 
So Choose it wisely. 

## The exit Game

The Exit Game is an excellent example of mixed-strategy Nash Equilibrium game.
It can teach us hoıw to calculate the overcome of such a game.

Our town Smallville has two grocery stores, Carrotco and Kalemart. 
Town has a massive decrease in population.
If both groceries stay they will lose money. 

If both stay each bussiness makes a loss K:-20 and C:-50. 
If both exit the market they both make 0 profit. 
If Kalemart stays while Carrotco exits K:80 and C:0
If Carrotco stays while Kalemart exits C: 100 and K: 0.

They both wants to become a Monopoly. 

For the situation where Carrotco stays.
Let's say the probability of staying for Kalemart is k.
So probability exit is (1 - k).
This will give us an equation.
Let's sum Carrotco's possible loss and profit. 

-50*k + 100*(1-k) = 0
=> 150*k = 100
=> k = 2/3

Kalemart stays with probability of 2/3 and exits with 1/3 probability. 

We looked at Carrotco's perspective.
We can also solve this equation from Kalemart's side. 
Let'S say the probability of Carrotco's stay is p. 
So the probability of exit is (1-p).

p*(-20) + (1-p)*80 = 0
=> 100p = 80
=> p 4/5

So Carrotco stays with 4/5 probability and exits with 1/5 probability. 

The probability of staying both groceries is 2/3 * 4/5 = 8/15.

The probability of both players exit is 1/3 * 1/5 = 1/15.

If both groceries want to stay, it creates a situation called war of attrition. 
This is a military term used in a situation where prize is smaller then the cost. 

## Purification

This theory is developed by Nobel Prize Winner Economist John Charles Hersanyi.

Purification theory says that if any uncertanity in the payoff's of normal matrix, actions taken by a player look randomized from other players perspective. 

## Tax Evasion 

Tax evasion game is a good example of a game with mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium. 

Suppouse that Emily is a tax payer. 
She can choose to avoid and gain money. 
If she get's an audit she loses a lot of money. 
For the Government's perspective making audit for everyone is excessively expensive. 

So there are tax payers and tax owners. 
Tax owners know the percentage of tax avoiders but do not know who is avoiding. 

Both players can implement mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium.
From tax owner's perspective they can make audits randomly. 
From tax payer's perspective they can avoid randomly. 

## Repeated Interactions

Back in 1883 French Economist Joseph Louis François Bertrand studied price competition. 
It is like Prisoners' Dilemma with self-interest, players have same types of incentives.

Bertrand predicted that each firm undercuts the other. 
Similar to the { confess, confess } outcome of the Prisoners' Dilemma. 

In some cases some firms make a treaty with each other and sell their products with high collusive prices. 
Most of the countries have some sort of "anti-trust" regulation for promoting competition. 

For understanding this type of situation we must move from one-shot games and understand repoeated interactions games where players play the same game over and over.

Would we observe cooperation in equilibrium in the Prisoners' Dilemma if players interact repeatedly?

For understanding the game with repeated actions we must predict the equilibrium in the last round. 

This is called backward induction. 

## What if there is No Definite Last Stage

In prisoners' dilemma the equilibrium is simple. 
If they play for two rounds payoffs do not change and they play same for two rounds. 

This can change if they play the game to infinity or they don't know the end of the game.

In this type of situations greedy acts can be punished in the future so firms can choose to cooperate. 

But if there does exist an end of the game and one player does see the end of the game, that player can act greedy. 

The other player can act greedy and maybe acts sacrificial if she is loosing the game. 
Founding the end point of the game is a must for winning. 

## Hawk-Dove Game

We can use practices from Game Theory in the field of Evolutuanary Biology.
Hawk and Dove game is such a game.

In the game there are two types of animals; Hawks and Doves.

Hawk type shows aggression and can give a physical fight fopr mating opportunuty or scarce resources.

Dove type of animals also can show aggression but it avoids physical conflict.

For a scarce resource these two types of animals compete.
This competition creates four outcome. 

1. If an Hawk type competes with a Dove type Hawk wins with payoff of 20 vice versa. 
2. If two Dove types compete with each other they do have equal chance of winning so both animals get a payyoff of 10.
3. If two Hawk types compete for a scarce resource they show pysical violance towards each other. 
They both have equal chance of winning but there does exist a payoff cost of physical injury c. So:
20/2 - c/2
=> (20 - c)/2

## Hawk-Dove Game With A Small Cost Conflict 

Let's assume are rational and cost of conflict c = 8.
This will create the normal matrix below:

In this situation when two Hawk types of animals compete they both have equal payoff of 6. 

In a competititon in between a Hawk and a Dove Hawk always wins.

But one of the key aspects of Evolutionary Game Theory is that animals are not making rational choices. 
They simply follow their genetic or social conditioning. 

For Hawk animals perspective they get 6 payoff if the other is a Hawk or get 20 payoff if the other is a Dove.

For Dove animals perspective they get 0 from competition with a Hawk type get payoff of 10 from competition with same type.

So being a Hawk is more rational if cost of conflict is less then the prize.
In these conditions animals tend to be Hawk reproduce more and after some time habitat in the land become Hawks.

This mechanism called survival of the fittest is developed by Sr. Charles Darwin.

## Hawk-Dove Game With A Large Cost Of Conflict

What if there is a large cost of conflict?
Let's say cost of conflict is c=24.
This will critically decrease payoff of competition in between two Hawk type animal.

Now you can see that payoff of competition in between two hawks is -2.
Other payoffs do not change because Dove type of animals still behave same.

So Let's calculate propportions of animals in population. 
A Dove type comes in conflict with an animal.
The animal is Hawk with probability of p and a Dove with (1-p) probability. 

0*p + 10*(1-p)
=> 10 - 10p

What is a Hawk type comes inb conflict with another animal. 
Let's say hawk is matched with another hawk with probability of p so this makes the probability of matching with a Dove (1-p).

-2*p + 20*(1-p)
=> 20 - 22p

So if evolutionary fitness of a Hawk is greater then a Dove type thus will create an inequality. 

20 - 22p > 10 - 10p
=> 10 > 12p
=> 5 > 6p
=> 5/6 > p

So 5/6 > p; thus proportion is steady state of tthe population called evolutuanary stable equilibrium. 
In this population proportion of Hawks does not pass the limit 5/6 and Dove's does not pasds the limit 1/6.
If we add more animals to this animal population, with time this population will be found this equilibrium because of high cost of conflict in between Hawks.

There are other solutions to this equation.
This equilibrium can change with mating oppotunuties and with scarce resources. 

If we add a lot of animals to a Herd with different behavioral patterns, new generations can adopt new behavioral patterns. 
This wil yield another equilibrium. 

You can solve Tax Evasion game with same method. 
You can play with Maxed Strategy Nash Equilibrium.
If you create Normal Form of the game you can calculate the proportions of Type A and Type B of players if they are rational.
Then you will implement the erquilibrium. 

## Sequential Move Games

If there is an order of actions in a game, this type of games are called sequential move games.
Many board games sucvh as chess is a sequential move game.

These games are dynamic.
Players can create strategies from observations of past moves or anticipations from post moves.

## A Dynamic Battle of Sexes Game

You remember Battle of Sexes game before; Amy and Bob wants to go a place together and they played a simultanousd move game with two equilibriums.

Let's change the game slightly.
Amy quits her job 1 hour earlier than Bob.
She decides to a place then calls Bob.

## The Extensive Form Of Game

In this form of Battle of Sexes game the normal form of the game does not so9lve our problem.
We need a more sophisticated way to represent this game. 
We will use the extensive form of the game. 

Now in this situation Amy's decision makes a significant impact on the game. 

                  Amy
                /     \
            Dance     Football
              /              \
            Bob               Bob
            /   \            /    \
        Dance  Football   Dance   Football
    (A:10 B:5) (A:0 B:0) (A:0 B:0) (A:10 B:5)

In this form of game every node shows a decision and every point shows a moment that a decision can be made. 

## Subgame Perfection 

So in this form of Battle of Sexes game when Amy makes a move, Bob needs to follow a side of the tree.

Let's say that Amy goes to football match; Bob needs to decide from right hand side of the tree.

There is a single Nash Equilibrium in this form of the game. 
Let's assume that all players are rational want to maximize their payoff.

Amy can decide to go to football mnatch and can get 5 payoff or she goes to dance class and get a payoff of 10.
So every player is rational Bob no matter what choice she makes, will follow her for best payoff. 
This situation makes going for dance class is more rational for Amy. 
So she chooses Dance Class and Bob will follow.

This is a sungame-perfect Nash Equilibrium. 
You can clearly see that in this game making the first move gives an advantage. 
This is a first mover advantage game. 
There are a lot of games where making the first move gives a dissadvantage to the first mover or vice versa.

## Credit Markets

The game of loaners and borrowers is a sequential move game. 

Let's say there does exist a Bank B and an Applicant A. 
Applicant wants to borrow money for an investment. 
There are two projects to invest; safe project and risky project. 

                Bank
                /  \
            Accept Reject
            /           \
        Appliccant      (A:0 B:0)
        /       \
      Safe      Risky
      /            \
    (A:1 B:2)      (A:10 B:0)

In this game Applicant will pay a fixed interest to the Bank.
So if she invests in risky project Bank gets no benefits. 
Also in the Risky project there is a high chance of the Applicant not giving the loan back. 

In equilibrium Bank does not give loan to the applicant. 
Because there si no benefit from Risky Project for Bank.

For changing the erquilibrium Applicant can give colateral. 
The applicant can give her family house as a colateral.
Maytbe the House has not much meaning to the Bank but has a lot of value(financial side) and meaning(psychological side) to the applicant. 

If she chooses the safe project with a colateral both players will benefit from the loan.
This willo result a Pareto Efficient result. 

This problemn of Banks is called Time Inconsistency Problem.
One solution to this is taking colateral. 

## Micro Credits

Time inconsistency problem makes colateral is a must.
What if people can't give a colateral?
They can't enter the market.
Poor stays poor, rich stays rich.

Bangladeshi Nobel Prize Winner Economist Muhammed Yunus finds an intuitive solution to this problem: the Micro Credits. 
In his bank credits will be given with smaller portions and they will not be given to individuals, the loans will be given to a group of people.

The psychological effects in a closely related people make a colateral effect. 

## Persistent Unemployment 

Macro Economists examine economical effects on large scale groups.
Persistent Unemployment problem is a good puzzle for them.

There do exist a lot of unemployed people willing to work.
From this reason firms can lower the wages and still fill the vacancies.
Without looking at psychological effects and looking only economical perspective expected result should be lower the wages untill there is same number of jobs and same number of unemployed people.

But in reality this is not happening. 
Because there are a lot of psychological effects in this game. 

There is a game with inpersistent information in between employee and manager.
Employee can shirk in his job if get caught he will lose his job.
But manager can't monitor her employees all the time.

If there are a lot of jobs in the market with fixed wage, employees will shirk in his/her jobs.
Because wages get lower and lower in proportion to rate of unemployment.
Firms start hiring in a low fixed wage. 
This will cause employees to shirk from their responsibilities.
They will not lose much from shirking they just simply find another job from the market if they got caught.

This is not good for firms so firms give more wages to less vacancies.

This will increase the wage of the position and also the rate of unemployment.
Firms can benefit from both side of this equation people work harder with increased wage and increased unemployment makes finding a job a lot harder.

So you can see that the game of manager and employee yields bigger wages and unemployment.
This is because of the game has inconsistent information in between players.
